A Bluetooth LE Library/Addon for openFrameworks

ofxBLE is an addon for openFrameworks (version 0.8.0+) based on RedBearLab's BLE framework and Apple's CoreBluetooth.framework that easily develop Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (aka BLE) Apps on openFrameworks.

For iOS devices, only iPhone 4s/5/5s, iPod touch 5 and iPad 3/4/Air/Mini have BLE 4.0 support.
For Mac devices, if no BLE hardware built-in, you need to buy an USB Bluetooth 4.0 dongle (CSR or Broadcom).
